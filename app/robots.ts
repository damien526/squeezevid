 * tool that wants to be cited correctly by an assistant has every interest in
 * being read by one, and silence reads as oversight rather than as a choice.
 * A crawler that reads only its own group sees the same exclusions as the
 * others, hence the repetition below.

/**
 * The only addresses not to crawl — two build artefacts, nothing more. There
 * is no account, no private area and no server route on this site.
 *
 * `index.txt` : Next drops one next to every `index.html`, carrying the React
 * payload for the same content. Served as plain text and indexable, it would
 * make every page exist twice, once in serialisation jargon. Verified present
 * in `out/` for all sixteen pages before this rule.
 *
 * `opengraph-image` : Next writes its PNG there without an extension, and a
 * static host serves it as `application/octet-stream`. It is not the address
 * the pages declare — they point at `/og/home.png`, copied by
 * `scripts/og-png.mjs` — but it answers all the same.
 *
 * ⚠ THE ORDER OF THOSE TWO FACTS MATTERS. Social crawlers
 * (`facebookexternalhit`, `Twitterbot`, `LinkedInBot`, `Slackbot`) respect
 * robots.txt. Closing `/opengraph-image` is only safe BECAUSE no `og:image`
 * tag points there any more. Whoever puts that address back in a tag must drop
 * the `Disallow` with it, or the previews go down site-wide.
